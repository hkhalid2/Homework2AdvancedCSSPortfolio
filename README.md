# Homework2AdvancedCSSPortfolio
This repository contains the second homework assignment which involved creating a portfolio using CSS and HTML.

The given acceptance criteria included; creating a webpage with the developer's name, photo, work and contact information, the UI scrolling to a certain section when a corresponding link is clicked, titled images of the developer's work, the first work's image should be larger than the other, the image of the application link to the deployed application, and finally when the screen is resized or changed the layout adapts to the viewport.

This assignment was a success for the most part besides the overall layout being exact to the given gif. All links goto the right locations, the page resizes well and flex elements were used so that the webpage resizes well. The project images also match the specifications, where the first is larger than the others. 

Conclusively, an html webpage was created from scratch and styled to meet specifications.
